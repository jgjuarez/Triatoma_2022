## Triatoma dimidiata and Chagas Disease - 10-Year Follow-up Analysis

Overview

This repository contains R scripts for the analysis of the manuscript Triatoma dimidiata infestation, Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and acute Chagas disease cases in Comapa, Jutiapa, Guatemala. The study presents a 10-year follow-up after an eco-bio-social intervention and was conducted between June and August 2022.

The analyses include:
	•	Entomological surveillance data processing
	•	Infestation and colonization indices calculation
	•	Bloodmeal source analysis using metabarcoding
	•	Molecular diagnostics of T. cruzi in vectors and domestic dogs
	•	Statistical analysis and visualization
